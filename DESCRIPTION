Description: Package containing a method to test the enrichment of a specific list of genes provided by the user in each cell of a scRNAseq dataset.
    The method is based on the comparison of the number of genes detected in the signature as compared to the number of genes detected in a lot of random 
    set of genes of the size of the interest gene list. The global detection rate of the gene list in each cell can be either significantly higher, lower 
    or not different to what it is expected randomly.
